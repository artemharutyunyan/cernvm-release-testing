\chapter{\cernvmreleasetesting Test Client Platform Setup}
\label{sct:testclientsetup}

\section{Introduction}
The intent of this document is to provided a step-by-step guide on setting up an entire \cernvmreleasetesting\ infrastructure, including instructions
on how to set up and configure test clients, the main server running the web interface and database, as well as writing and executing tests. If you are
new to release testing and want a document to guide you through the entire process of setting up a working \cernvmreleasetesting\ infrastructure,
then this guide for you.

This section provides complete step by step instructions on how to setup and configure the test clients which are part of a basic working
\releasetesting environment by outlining the procedure for setting up test clients on numerous platforms, hence why this is called a 
\emph{walkthrough} document. This guide is intended for users familiar enough with computers and desktop environments to enter basic commands
in a terminal and install various operating systems. 

As this guide is directed towards users who are new to \cernvmreleasetesting and \tapper and
are interested in quickly getting a \cernvm testing infrastructure quickly set up, many assumptions regarding the requirements necessary are made.
As is the case, these instructions are provided for a generalized audience based on our own experience and the requirements that we feel most users
will have, \emph{so feel free to deviate from the instructions}.

\section{Debian Based Test Client Setup}
\subsection{Installing the system}
\flushleft
\begin{enumerate}
\item First, begin by loading the Debian Squeeze CD and select the `default install' at the initial boot menu.

\item For the first few installation options, such as default language and keyboard layout simply leave the default values and select
`next' unless you have different requirements than the default options.

\item When prompted to enter the hostname for the computer, enter a relevant hostname for the machine based on the hardware or operating
system it is running; the hostname should be relevant and unique as \tapper will use this hostname to idenify the system. A good naming
convention should refer to the hardware or operating system and call it a host to differentiate from the virtual machine that will be
running as a guest\footnote{This will make more sense later when you have to create and configure CernVM images}, for example a hostname such
as \emph{cernvm-debian6-host} could be used, {\bf whatever conventions you use make sure it is consistent}.

\item Next, when prompted to enter the password for the root password, set the root password to something you will not forget and is fairly
difficult with numbers and letters.

\item Next, when prompted to enter a username for the new user to be created on the system, set the username as something simple and relevant
such as \emph{cernvm} and the password to something you will not forget and is fairly complex with numbers and letters. But, most importantly 
{\bf keep this username and password consistent across all systems created as part of the infrastructure} as it makes administration and everything
else much easier.

\item When prompted for the timezone simply configure the timezone according to your local time zone, such as CEST

\item Now, when prompted by the installer to configure the partitioning layout, if there are other operating systems installed on the system 
select the `Automatic Partitioning' option, and if available select the option `Use Remaining Free Space'. Otherwise, if there are no other 
operating system installed on the hard drive select the `Manual' option, \emph{beware that doing so will erase everything on the hard drive}.
Using the manual option, create two primary partitions, with the first taking up the size of the hard drive minus twice the size of the amount
of RAM installed, and the second primary partition as a SWAP file using the remaining free space. The following is an example of what the partiton
layout would look like for a 40.0 GB hard drive with 2GB of ram.

\begin{lstlisting}
#1	PRIMARY	36.0 GB		Bf	EXT4	/
#2	PRIMARY	4.0  GB		 f	SWAP	SWAP
\end{lstlisting}

\item When prompted, select yes to use a network mirror and select a mirror near your location and in a country with a reputable 
connection/internet infrastructure such as (USA, Netherlands, Germany, France).

\item When prompted to choose software to install, select the following
\begin{itemize}
\item 	Graphical desktop environment
\item 	SSH Server
\item	Standard system utilities
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\item After that the system should soon complete the installation, after the installation has finished ensure that you reboot the system and remove
the CD so that the system does not load the CD again when it starts.
