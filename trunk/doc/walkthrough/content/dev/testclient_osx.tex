\section{OS X Test Client Setup}
\subsection{Configuring the system}
\label{sec:osxconfig}

\begin{enumerate}
\item	After the system has booted, the first thing to configure are the power management settings and other preferences, as this system
		will be running as a test client, sleep and other automatic energy saving features must be disabled. Begin by navigating to the
		power options, \verb|Apple logo -> System Preferences -> Energy Saver| for the option ``Computer sleep'' slide the bar to the
		far right so that it is set to ``Never'' and ensure that the following options are all disabled.
\begin{itemize}
\item	Put the hard disk(s) to sleep when possible

\item	Wake for Ethernet network access

\item 	Allow power button to put the computer to sleep
\end{itemize}

\item	Next, set a hostname for the system from the menu \verb|Apple logo -> System Preferences -> Sharing| beside the ``Computer Name:''
		option at the top, click the ``Edit...'' button. Then enter a relevant hostname for the system based on the hardware or operating
		system it is running; the hostname should be relevant and unique to better identify the system. A good naming convention should 
		refer to the hardware or operating system and call it a host to differentiate from the virtual machine that will be running as 
		a guest, for example a hostname such as \emph{cernvm-osx-host} could be used, {\bf whatever convention you use make sure it is 
		consistent}.

\item	Next, enable SSH access to the system by navigating to \verb|Apple logo -> System Preferences -> Sharing| and from the list of 
		services that can be shared, enable ``Remote Login'', which is SSH.
		
\item	Now, to enable VNC access to the system, select from the same list of services that can be shared, ``Remote Management'' and
		for local access options window that appears, enable all of the options listed such as ``Observe'' and ``Change settings''.
		Then to enable VNC compatibilty so that the OS X system can be accessed by other non-Apple computers, click the ``Computer
		Settings...'' button and enable the following options and set a password for the ``VNC viewers...'' option.
\begin{itemize}
\item	Show Remote Management status in menu bar
\item	Anyone may request permission to control screen
\item	VNC viewers may control screen with password
\end{itemize}

\item	Now, to ensure that your user logs in automatically, navigate to \verb|Apple logo -> System Preferences -> Accounts| and click
		``Login Options'', you may have to click on the lock icon and enter your password in order to make changes to the login options. 
		Then for the option ``Automatic login:'' select your user from the list of accounts to enable automatic login.
		
\item 	Finally, to ensure that the settings were configured properly, reboot the machine and ensure that the following work.
\begin{itemize}
\item	It automatically boots up into the full desktop environment without having to login
\item	You have access to the machine using SSH and can login
\item	You have VNC access to the machine and can control the system using VNC	
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}




\subsection{Installing libvirt and virsh}
\label{sec:osxvirsh}
\begin{enumerate}
\item	The virtualization API libvirt and the command line tool virsh~\cite{libvirt} are the essential components required 
		for setting up a test client and must be installed and properly configured before any testing can begin. Ensure that
		you follow the proceeding directions carefully and validate that virsh is working properly before proceeding to 
		install and configure the various hypervisors.

\item	First, to install libvirt, begin by installing Homebrew\footnote{Homebrew is a package manager for OS X, which is similar to apt, it will
                be used to install dependencies instead of manually building from source} using the following command, for a more detailed
                installation guide refer to the Homebrew wiki  \url{https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/wiki/ Installation}.

\lstset{language=bash, caption=Install Homebrew}
\begin{lstlisting}
# Install Homebrew using the following command
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/gist/323731)"
\end{lstlisting}

\item        Next, download and install Xcode, which is freely available at \url{http://developer.apple.com/xcode/}. At the moment Xcode 3 can
                be downloaded for free, whereas Xcode 4 costs money and must be purchased from the Apple App store\footnote{There is still one
                catch, in order to download Xcode 3, which is free, you must first make an Apple developer account}, this guide uses the freely
                available Xcode 3, which at the time of writing is version 3.2.6.

\item        Next, to install libvirt simply use the following command, please note, in the unlikely event that there has not been an updated
                "formula" to install a newer version of libvirt, then you can attempt to either create one or update the current libvirt formula and 
                benefit yourself and others who may install libvirt using Homebrew.  The following are instruction for creating a formula 
                \url{https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/wiki/Formula- Cookbook}.
                
\lstset{language=bash, caption=Install libvirt}
\begin{lstlisting}
# Install libvirt using the following command
brew install libvirt
\end{lstlisting}

\item 	Finally, ensure that virsh installed correctly and is running by connecting to the test hypervisor and ensuring 
		that the test virtual machine, named ``test'' is running.

\lstset{language=bash,caption=Verify virsh was Installed Properly}
\begin{lstlisting}
# Verify virsh is working, test should be running
$ virsh -c test:///default list --all
\end{lstlisting}
\end{enumerate}




\subsection{Installing and configuring VirtualBox}
\label{sec:osxvbox}
\begin{enumerate}
\item	First, begin by downloading and installing a version of VirtualBox supported by libvirt for OS X from the VirtualBox download 
		page, it is best to download the latest version within the series \emph{that has been available for at least a month prior to the release
		of the version of libvirt installed}. VirtualBox can be downloaded from the following location,  
		\url{http://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads} ensure that you select the appropriate architecture for your system. The following
		 instructions for this section of the guide uses VirtualBox 4.0.10 for AMD64.
		
\item	Next, to verify that VirtualBox has been installed properly and that virsh can connect to the VirtualBox hypervisor, 
		verify that the following VirtualBox kernel extensions are loaded.
		
\begin{itemize}
\item	org.virtualbox.kext.VBoxDrv
\item	org.virtualbox.kext.VBoxUSB
\item	org.virtualbox.kext.VBoxNetFlt
\item	org.virtualbox.kext.VBoxNetAdp
\end{itemize}

\lstset{language=bash,caption=Verify that VirtualBox Kernel Exentsions are Loaded}
\begin{lstlisting}
# Verify that the kernel extentsions are loaded
$ kextstat | grep -i virtualbox
\end{lstlisting}

\item        Finally, verify that VirtualBox has been configured properly and that virsh supports the current version of VirtualBox installed
                by connecting to the virsh console for the VirtualBox hypervisor.

\lstset{language=bash,caption=Verify VirtualBox Works with Virsh}
\begin{lstlisting}
# Verify that virsh can connect to virtualbox
$ virsh --connect vbox:///session
\end{lstlisting}
\end{enumerate}




\subsection{Installing and configuring VMware}
\label{sec:osxvmware}
\begin{enumerate}
\item	First, begin by downloading and installing the latest version of VMware Fusion for OS X from the VMware product 
		page, \url{http://www.vmware.com/products/}, VMware Fusion requires a license, so you will have to purchase it
		in order to continue.
		
\item	Next, to verify that VMware Fusion has been installed properly, verify that the following VMware kernel extensions 
		are loaded, currently virsh has support to connect to the VMware hypervisor and has only recently supported connecting
		to VMware Fusion since I added support in version 0.9.5 of libvirt.
		
\begin{itemize}
\item	com.vmware.kext.vmx86
\item	com.vmware.kext.vmci
\item	com.vmware.kext.vmioplug
\item	com.vmware.kext.vmnet
\end{itemize}

\lstset{language=bash,caption=Verify VMware Kernel Extensions Loaded}
\begin{lstlisting}
# Verify that the kernel extentsions are loaded
$ kextstat | grep -i vmware
\end{lstlisting}

.\item      Finally, verify that VMware Fusion has been configured properly and that virsh supports the current version of VMware Fusion
                installed by connecting to the virsh console for the VMware Fusion hypervisor.

\lstset{language=bash,caption=Verify VMware Fusion Works with Virsh}
\begin{lstlisting}
# Add VMware Fusion to PATH
$ export PATH=/Library/Application\ Support/VMware\ Fusion/:$PATH
$ export PATH=/Applications/VMware\ Fusion.app/Contents/MacOS:$PATH

# Verify that virsh can connect to vmware fusion
$ virsh --connect vmwarews:///session
\end{lstlisting}
\end{enumerate}




\subsection{Setting up the Tapper Test Suite}
\label{sec:osxtestsuite}
\begin{enumerate}
\item 	{\bf Before proceeding any further ensure that you have all other test clients set up this far, and then proceed
		to follow the instructions for setting up and configuring the \tapper~server in the section ``Server Platform Setup''}		
		~\ref{sec:serversetup}.
		
\item 	Now that the \tapper~server has been installed and configured and the \tapper web interface and database have proven
		to be working, the next step is to verify that the test client can actually send a report to the \tapper~server in
		the form of a TAP file. After sending the TAP report to the server, ensure that the test client is working by viewing 
		the tapper reports in your browser at the following url: \url{http:/<tapper\_server>/tapper/reports}. You should now see a 
		report from the test client, there should be a report from a system named whatever the ``Tapper-Machine-Name'' in 
		demo\_report.tap was set as. \emph{For the example demo\_report.tap provided below it would be cernvm-osxtestclient}.
		\footnote{This is why a consistent hostname convention was emphasized earlier, as reports are often sorted and organized 
		based on hostnames}.
		
\lstset{language=bash,caption=Send a Basic Report to the \tapper~Server}
\begin{lstlisting}
# Save the following in a file named demo_report.tap

	1..2
	# Tapper-Suite-Name: Tapper-Deployment
	# Tapper-Suite-Version: 1.001
	# Tapper-Machine-Name: cernvm-osxtestclient
	ok - Hello World
	ok - Just another description

# Send the report to the tapper server using netcat
$ cat demo_report.tap | nc -w10 cernvm-server 7357
\end{lstlisting}

\item 	Next, download a copy of the CernVM Test Suite and the CernVM Test Cases from the Google Code svn repository
		\cite{GCreleasetesting} and install the the following dependencies.
			
\lstset{language=bash,caption=Install CernVM Test Suite}
\begin{lstlisting}
# Install subversion, required to checkout auto-tapper
$ brew install subversion

# Checkout a copy of auto-tapper and cernvm testcases
$ svn checkout http://cernvm-release-testing.googlecode.com/svn/\
trunk/tapper/tapper-autoreport/ cernvm-testsuite
\end{lstlisting}

\item        Now, install the following dependencies using Homebrew\footnote{This section is extremely short in comparison to the previous
                instructions for this section which required building the dependencies from source}.
                
\lstset{language=bash,caption=Install Dependencies}
\begin{lstlisting}
# Install the following dependencies
$ brew install ssh-copy-id
$ brew install wget
$ brew install ossp-uuid
$ brew install spawn-fcgi
$ brew install md5sha1sum
$ brew install curl
\end{lstlisting}

\item	Now that cernvm-testsuite has been installed, configure the variables in the configuration file for the
			hypervisors you want to test and according to your \tapper infrastructure setup. Sample configuration files are provided
			in the {\bf config} folder, all of the settings provided in the configuration files by default are the {\bf mandatory, minimum 
			configuration options} and in most cases the	defaults should be sufficient for testing, the only mandatory settings that are
			not provided by default {\bf and must be configured manually are CVM\_TS\_REPORT\_SERVER and 
			CVM\_VM\_IMAGE\_VERSION }. Please refer to the developer manual for a more complete detailed list of the mandatory and 
			optional configuration settings.

\begin{description}
\item[CVM\_TS\_SUITENAME]	Must ALWAYS be set, the default suite name in the configuration file should be suitable

	  		  
\item[CVM\_TS\_SUITEVERSION] 	Must ALWAYS be set, reflects the release version number of the test suite framework, the  default
								version given in the configuration should only be changed if you customize/update the scripts

\item[CVM\_TS\_REPORT\_SERVER]	Must ALWAYS be set, this is the ip address or hostname of the Tapper report server which the reports
      							from the test results are sent to
		
\item[CVM\_TS\_DOWNLOAD\_PAGE]	Must ALWAYS be set, normally the default url provided in the configuration file is accurate, but in the
								event that the internal \cernvm image release page is relocated then this url must be changed.

\item[CVM\_VM\_HYPERVISOR]	Must ALWAYS be set, should not have to change the defaul hypervisor in the configuration files, valid values 
							(case sensitive) are {\bf kvm,vbox,vmware}

\item[CVM\_VM\_TEMPLATE]		Must ALWAYS be set, normally the default template provided in the configuration file should not be changed,
								only change this to use a custom template file. The custom template file \emph{must be placed within the
								templates folder}

\item[CVM\_VM\_NET\_TEMPLATE]	Must ALWAYS be set, normally the default network template provided in the configuration file should not be
	 							changed, only change this to use a custom network template file for the \cernvm image,  {\bf only applies to kvm
	 							and virtualbox}. The custom network template file \emph{must be placed within the templates folder}

\item[CVM\_VM\_IMAGE\_VERSION]	Must ALWAYS be set, specifies the version of the CernVM image to use from the release page
	
\item[CVM\_VM\_IMAGE\_TYPE]		Must ALWAYS be set,  specifies the type of CernVM image, valid image types supported, (case sensitive) are 
								{\bf basic and desktop}

\item[CVM\_VM\_ARCH]		Must ALWAYS be set, specifies the architecture of the \cernvm image, valid architectures (case sensitive) are {\bf 
							x86 and x86\_64}
\end{description}	

\item	Finally, now that cernvm-testsuite has been installed and configured on the test client and the test client and \tapper~Server
			have proven to be working, the next step is to verify that cernvm-testsuite works correctly and can actually send a report to 	
			the \tapper~server in the form of a TAP file. To execute the \cernvm Test Cases script, ``cernvm-tests.sh'' simply source
			the configuration file you wish to use and execute the script. Once the script has completed and sent a TAP report to the server, 
			ensure that the test client is working by viewing the tapper reports in your browser at the  following 
			url: \url{http:/<tapper\_server>/tapper/reports}. You should now see a new report from the test client, there should be a 
			report from a system with the same hostname.\footnote{This is why a consistent hostname convention was emphasized earlier, as 
			reports are often sorted and organized based on hostnames}.

\lstset{language=bash,caption=Execute CernVM Test Cases Script}
\begin{lstlisting}
# Simply source the configuration file, and execute the script
$ . ./config/<configuration_file>
$ ./cernvm-tests.sh
\end{lstlisting}
\end{enumerate}
